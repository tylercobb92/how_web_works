    What is HTTP?
        Hyper Text Transfer Protocol: rules for how data is transferred between computers/servers.
    What is a URL?
        Uniform Resource Locator: human readable web address for internet resources
    What is DNS?
        Domain Name System: computer readable web address for internet resources; URLs are turned into a series of numbers, which are IP addresses.
    What is a query string?
        A piece at the end of a URL that indicates key=value pairs. It follows a ? in the URL and is often seen when searching the internet.
    What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
        GET: get is a request to retrive data from a computer to a server; this does not change info on the server
        POST: post is a request to submit data from a computer to a server; this involves storing/changing the information on the server in some way.
    What is an HTTP request?
        This is a request from a computer to a server following the HTTP protocol.
    What is an HTTP response?
        This is a response from a server to a computer following the HTTP protocol.
    What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.
        Request headers include details about the requesting computer and attributes that the response should have. These headers include 'Host:' and 'Accept:'.
        Response headers have details about the formatting of the data on the server that is sent in response to a request. These headers include 'Server:' and 'Content-Type:'.
    What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? 
        When a URL is typed into a browser it is first translated into an IP address. This IP address is mapped to a specific DNS, and a request including request headers is sent from the computer to that server. The server sends a response, including a code (eg 200 for successful, 404 for not found) and response headers, back to the computer. The code within the response is made into a DOM, and more requests for resources such as images are sent as needed. All of this information is turned into the webpage that we see.
